# What is OntoWiki? What can it do for you?

OntoWiki is a semantic application as well as a framework which acts as a hardened basement for your application in the Semantic Web context. One of its main purposes is to assist you managing your knowledge. Knowledge means here machine readable data organized as [RDF/XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF/XML), [Notation3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3), Turtle as well as [Talis(JSON)](http://docs.api.talis.com/platform-api/output-types/rdf-json). You organize your knowledge using an feature-rich user interface managing classes, properties and resources. *If you don't know what is this all about, please have a look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) (and associated pages) before continue reading*. Furthermore what OntoWiki can do for you:
* Providing feature rich user interface to helping you organize and manage resources, relations between resources, classes, ... . We heavily use modern browser technologies to give you a smooth user experience.
* It is a [Linked Data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) server for you data as well as a [Linked Data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) client to fetch additional data from the web
* It is a Semantic Pingback Client in order to receive and send back-linking request as known from the blogosphere
* You can use the backend you know to store your data, because OntoWiki is backend independent, which means you can save your data on a MySQL database as well as on a Virtuoso Triple Store

But thats not all, OntoWiki provides a rich set of extensions. In the following a collection:
* Wikipedia like [Wiki's](https://github.com/AKSW/article.ontowiki/wiki): create wiki pages using Markdown and have to possibility to attach wiki pages to existing resources
* [PubSubHubbub](https://github.com/AKSW/pubsub.ontowiki#pubsubontowiki) to spread your local knowledge changes over the web and be synced with foreign sources 
* Extension named [CubeViz](https://github.com/AKSW/cubeviz.ontowiki/wiki) for visualization of statistical data which are organized in the [DataCube](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) format. OntoWiki + CubeViz are already in use for the [Open Data portal](http://open-data.europa.eu/en/apps) of the European Union!
* [Integration](https://github.com/AKSW/map.ontowiki) of maps - if your data containing geographical information you are able to see it on a map
