We got a centralized Repository for extensions. Every OntoWiki can browse the available extensions and provides a install mechanism. http://[your-ow.com]/exconf/explorerepo

The Repo is available to register new extensions [here](http://extensions.ontowiki.net)
As the [short documentation](http://extensions.ontowiki.net/Help.html) says there are four steps, which we will explain a bit deeper here.

1. Develop your OntoWiki extension and release it somewhere
  develop the source files [Extensions HowTo], test your extensions locally, package into a zip archive, put it on a accessable webserver. We recommend GitHub.
2. Create an RDF document which describes your extension
  "eat your semantic dogfood" - create a [DOAP](https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki) file (as Turtle, NTriple or RDF/XML). Have a look [here](https://github.com/AKSW/site.ontowiki/blob/master/doap.n3) for an example on what properties are required. For example: 
* title, 
* author, 
* description, 
* link to the zip (Pro-Tip: if you use GitHub, this link can be omitted and the autogenerated zip of the master branch will be used), 
optional: 
* versions (older versions with each a zip), 
* extensions-internal config
3. Publish that description document as Linked Data on the web
Pro-Tip: if you use GitHub, and you use the URL of the DOAP file as the URI of your extension (use that URI within the DOAP file), you will get pseudo-linked-data for free. for example the URI of the "site" extensions is https://github.com/AKSW/site.ontowiki/blob/master/doap.n3
4. Ping this registry to integrate your extension meta data here
either you enter this URI in the form and hit submit or (much more awesome) you "ping" http://extensions.ontowiki.net with a [semantic ping](http://aksw.org/Projects/SemanticPingBack). The Repository will then retrieve your DOAP file and update its index. Your extensions becomes visible to millions of OntoWiki instances within seconds.
