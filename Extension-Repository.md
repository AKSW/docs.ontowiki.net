We got a centralized Repository for extensions. Every OntoWiki can browse the available extensions and provides a install mechanism: in the [Extension-Configurator] or directly at http://your-ontowiki/exconf/explorerepo

The Repository is quite unique. It is basically a SPARQL-endpoint, which contains a repo model which imports multiple extension-models. A extension model contains DOAP data. The client within the Extension Configurator queries this model for all doap:Projects (which are extensions in our case).

This is what the list of available extenions looks like:
![repoclient](https://github.com/AKSW/OntoWiki/wiki/images/exconf-explore.png)

You can register new extensions [here](http://extensions.ontowiki.net). 
![reposerver](https://github.com/AKSW/OntoWiki/wiki/images/reposerver.png)

Registering a new or updated extension with our repo is basically just a import of its DOAP description into the repo model.
As the [short documentation](http://extensions.ontowiki.net/Help.html) says there are four steps to register a new extension, which we will explain a bit deeper here.

## Develop your OntoWiki extension and release it somewhere 
Develop the source files ([HowTo](Extensions)), test your extensions locally, package into a zip archive, put it on a accessable webserver. We recommend GitHub (you will have the autogenerated zip of the current state there).
## Create an RDF document which describes your extension 
"eat your semantic dogfood" - create a [DOAP](https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki) file (as Turtle, NTriple or RDF/XML). Have a look [here](https://github.com/AKSW/site.ontowiki/blob/master/doap.n3) for an example on what properties are required. For example: 
* name (doap:name - the internal id of the extension. e.g. the folder name), 
* title (rdfs:label - the human readable name, 
* author (doap:maintainer - a URI for the author), 
* description (doap:description - a short abstract of what the extension does), 
* link to the zip - either from the versions (property: doap:file-release) or from the project (property:  http://ns.ontowiki.net/SysOnt/ExtensionConfig/latestZip) (protip: if you use GitHub, this link can be omitted and the autogenerated zip of the master branch will be used), 
optional: 
* versions (older versions with each a zip), 
* extensions-internal config (look at the example - we came up with a rather complex way to encode multidimensional config arrays)
optional: if you already have a default.ini file you can convert it with the file application/scripts/extensions-ini2n3.php (which takes a extension folder as an argument) (the script is currently only in the feature/semantic-extensions branch). This script is especially usefull when you have many config options.

## Publish that description document as Linked Data on the web 
protip: if you use GitHub, and you use the URL of the DOAP file as the URI of your extension (use that URI within the DOAP file), you will get pseudo-linked-data for free. for example the URI of the "site" extensions is https://github.com/AKSW/site.ontowiki/raw/master/doap.n3#site (notice the "raw", which delivers the file and not a html view on it)

### Ping this registry to integrate your extension meta data here 
Either you enter this URI in the form on http://extensions.ontowiki.net and hit submit 

or (much more awesome) you "ping" http://extensions.ontowiki.net with a [semantic ping](http://aksw.org/Projects/SemanticPingBack) by stating a triple 
 <yourExtensionURI> <http://ns.ontowiki.net/SysOnt/ExtensionConfig/registeredAt> <http://extensions.ontowiki.net/>
in your semantic pingback-enabled application (e.g. OntoWiki)
The Repository listens to this event and will then retrieve your DOAP file and update its index. Your extensions becomes visible to millions of OntoWiki instances within seconds.
