milestones as well as current construction sites

Feel free to pick up one of this list and help us with this :-)

## Roadmap

- Schema / Ontology Documentation (started with site extension)
- Advanced Versioning (started in branch Feature-AdvancedVersioning)
- Drag & Drop (started in default)
- Consolidation of Widget API and included widgets
- Increasing extendibility by simplifying and robustifying the scheme by which editing actions are passed between OntoWiki and the Erfurt API
- Template usage for rendering instance data (currently done through static method calls)
- Blank Nodes
- URI Normalizer (rewrite URIs before write to the system. lower case, directory part url encoding, decompose relative parts "./.." . see URI RFC for this.)
- dependencies between extensions

## done

- Extension Management (finished in branch Feature-ExtensionUnification)
- List Template Rewrite
- Object Cache
- Evolution Patterns (merged into default since [http:_code.google.com/p/ontowiki/source/detail?r=edcda1071a1539bf09a95f01cade4c8bad354e70_](edcda1071a))
