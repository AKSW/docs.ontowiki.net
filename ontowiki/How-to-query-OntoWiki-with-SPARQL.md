OntoWiki as a semantic web application also provides a query interface, which understands SPARQL mainly in [Version 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).
The support for [SPARQL 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is still under development.

The query interface can be accessed through the user interface, after a model was selected, though the menu "Extras" > "Queries".

There is also a HTTP SPARQL endpoint available under `<ontowiki>/sparql`.
