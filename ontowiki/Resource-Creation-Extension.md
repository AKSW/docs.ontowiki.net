This plug-in provides the possibility to define a URI scheme which will be applied, when new resources are created. This means e.g., all new project resources will be created as `http://aksw.org/Projects/NewResource`.

The naming is applied by these rules:
1. start the URI with the model base URI (should end with a slash `/`)
1. add the class specific or default naming scheme to this URI.

The default naming scheme is `type/label`.
`type` and `label` are placeholders which are replaces with the following values:

* `type` will be replaced by the title of the class.
The title is generated by the TitleHelper so [a lot of properties](https://github.com/AKSW/OntoWiki/blob/develop/application/config/default.ini#L34) are comprise in order to generate the title.
The generated title is modified according to different URI restrictions.

To provide a specfic URI component title for a class, you can annotate it with `sysont:creationLabel` e.g. the following annotation in your knowledge base would create new `foaf:Person` resources as `BASE/Persons/NewResource`:

```
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix sysont: <http://ns.ontowiki.net/SysOnt/> .

foaf:Person sysont:creationLabel "Persons" .
```
Note: This statement has to be added to the knowledge base where your resources are created, no the config knowledge base.

* `label` is replaced in the same way by using the TitleHelper to generate a title based on the given data of the new resource.

In order to change the default naming scheme from `type/label` to something more sophisticated, you can annotate class specific naming schemes by using the `sysont:instanceNamingScheme` property.

Lets have a look  at the following class annotation:
```
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix sysont: <http://ns.ontowiki.net/SysOnt/> .

foaf:Person sysont:instanceNamingScheme "instances/person/label" .
```

This annotation changes the naming scheme in a way that new `foaf:Person` resources will be created as `BASE/instances/person/NewResource`.
