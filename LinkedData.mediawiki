= What do I need to publish Linked Data with OntoWiki? =

In order to publish you data as Linked Data, you have to follow these steps:

== Activate the linked data plugin ==
it is default activated ...

== Make sure your URIs are part of the OntoWiki installation namespace==
If your OntoWiki is under http://example.org/OntoWiki/ you shoud create a Knowledge Base http://example.org/OntoWiki/YourData/ or similar and create your resources in it like http://example.org/OntoWiki/YourData/Person/Norm .

== Make sure your Knowledge Base is readable by the Anonymous User ==
Login as an Admin, search for Users in the System Config and and add your Knowledge Base to the property `readable model` for the Anonymous User.

It is also possible to restrict the access to your Linked data but this means that linked data clients need to authenticate with HTTP auth.

= How can I test my Linked Data URIs? =

On linux you can simply use this shell command with your URL: `wget -q -O - --header="Accept: application/rdf+xml" YOURURL` and look for the incomming RDF/XML.

If you want to try it with FOAF+SSL look there: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/foaf/HOWTO_Use_FOAF_SSL_from_a_command_line
